## Resume
I built this resume project by writing JavaScript that effectively combines my personal information with some provided, pre-written HTML and CSS templates. I learned basic JavaScript syntax such as how to manipulate data, build loops and create functions. I also learned a few jQuery DOM manipulation methods.
